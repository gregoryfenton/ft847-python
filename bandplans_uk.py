UK Amateur Radio band plans

Pass the current frequency in Hz and it will return the following:
	F Full licensees only
	I Intermediate licensees or higher
	f foundation licensees or higher
	L Licence free range
	B Beacons only
	G Guard channel
	O Out of band
	N Notice of Variation only for Full licensees

Data taken from the 2018 RSGB band plan as of 28 January 2018

Written by Gregory Fenton M6LWY 28 January 2018

Recall that the FT847 does not output the final decimals column
so all hertz figures must be multiplied by 10 to get the actual
value in hertz (rounded to 10)
